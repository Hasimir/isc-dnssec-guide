 <title>Why is DNSSEC Important? (Why Should I Care?)</title>
 <para>You might be thinking to yourself: all this DNSSEC stuff sounds
 wonderful, but why should I care? Below are some reasons why you may want to
 consider deploying DNSSEC:

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>Be a good netizen</emphasis>: By enabling DNSSEC
    validation (as described in <xref linkend="dnssec-validation" />) on your
    DNS servers, you're protecting your users or yourself a little more by
    checking answers returned to you; by signing your zones (as described in
    <xref linkend="dnssec-signing" />), you are making it possible for other
    people to verify your zone data. As more people adopt DNSSEC, the Internet
    as a whole becomes more secure for everyone.</simpara>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>Compliance</emphasis>: You may not even get a say
    whether or not you want to implement DNSSEC, if your organization is
    subject to compliance standards that mandate it. For example, the US
    government set a deadline back in 2008, to have all <code>.gov</code> sub
    domains signed by the December 2009 <footnote><para>The Office of
    Management and Budget (OMB) for the US government published a memo in 2008
    (<ulink
    url="www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2008/m08-23.pdf"
    />), requesting all <code>.gov</code> sub-domains to be DNSSEC signed by
    December 2009. This explains why <code>.gov</code> is the most deployed
    DNSSEC domain currently, with more than 80% sub domains
    signed.</para></footnote>. So if you operated a sub domain in
    <code>.gov</code>, you must implement DNSSEC in order to be compliant. One
    of the widely used compliance standards, PCI DSS for the payment card
    industry, has been rumored to list DNSSEC as a requirement or
    recommendation, as part of its on-going efforts to enhance security for
    online payment transactions.
<!-- TODO: find source for the PCI DSS "rumor" and make this more precise. -->
    ICANN also requires that all new top-level domains support DNSSEC.</simpara>

   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>C.Y.A.</emphasis>: Okay, so the big lofty goal of "let's
    be good" doesn't appeal to you, and you don't have any compliance standards
    to worry about . Here is a more practical reason why you should consider
    DNSSEC: in case of a DNS-based security breach, such as cache poisoning or
    domain hijacking, after all the financial and brand damage done to your
    domain name, you might be placed under scrutiny for any preventative
    measure that could have been put in place. Think of this like having your
    web site only available via HTTP but not HTTPS.</simpara>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>New Features</emphasis>: DNSSEC brings not only enhanced
    security, but with that new level of security, a whole new suite of
    features. Once DNS can be trusted completely, it becomes possible to
    publish SSL certificates in DNS, or PGP keys for fully automatic
    cross-platform email encryption, or SSH fingerprints... People are still
    coming up with new features, but this all relies on a trust-worthy DNS
    infrastructure. To take a peek at these next generation DNS features, check
