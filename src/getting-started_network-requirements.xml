 <para>From a network perspective, DNS and DNSSEC packets are very similar,
 DNSSEC responses just look bigger. You should test for the following two
 items, to make sure your network is ready for DNSSEC:

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>DNS over TCP</emphasis>: Verify network connectivity
    over TCP port 53, this may mean updating firewall policies or Access
    Control List (ACL) on routers. See <xref linkend="dns-uses-tcp"/> more
    details.</simpara>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <simpara><emphasis>Large UDP packets</emphasis>: Some network gears such as
    firewall may make assumptions about the size of DNS UDP packets and reject
    DNS traffic that appears too big. See <xref
    linkend="whats-edns0-all-about"/> for more details.</simpara>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
