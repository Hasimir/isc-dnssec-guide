 <title>NSEC3 Troubleshooting</title>

 <para>BIND includes a tool called <command>nsec3hash</command> that runs
 through the same steps a validating resolver would, to generate the
 correct hashed name based on NSEC3PARAM parameters. The command takes the
 following parameters in order: salt, algorithm, iterations, and domain.
 For example, if the salt is 1234567890ABCDEF, hash algorithm is 1, and
 iteration is 10, to get the NSEC3-hashed name for
 <code>www.example.com</code> we would execute a command like this:</para>

 <screen>$ <userinput>nsec3hash 1234567890ABCEDF 1 10 www.example.com</userinput>
RN7I9ME6E1I6BDKIP91B9TCE4FHJ7LKF (salt=1234567890ABCEDF, hash=1, iterations=10)</screen>

 <para>While it is unlikely you would construct a rainbow table of your
 own zone data, this tool might be useful to troubleshoot NSEC3
 problems.</para>
