 <title>Easy Start Guide for Recursive Servers</title>
 <para>This section provides the minimum amount of information to setup a working DNSSEC-aware recursive server, also known as a validating resolver. A validating resolver performs validation for each remote response received, following the chain of trust to verify the answers it receives are legitimate through the use of public key cryptography and hashing functions.</para>
 
<!-- TODO: jreed: enabled by default but not useful by default
since no trust anchor configured by default;
maybe this section should explain the auto here before testing  -->

<!-- TODO: jkuo Wed Oct 15 01:52:14 UTC 2014
Added a little clarification, since most people use a pre-packaged
version of BIND that came with their OS, some packages have
everything taken care of (trust anchor + configuration). This 
is just to remind/advise users to check if their name servers
are already validating, before changing configuration files. -->

 <para>You may not need to reconfigure your name server at all, since recent versions of BIND packages and distributions have been shipped with DNSSEC validation enabled by default. Before making any configuration changes, check whether or not you already have DNSSEC validation by following steps described in <xref linkend="how-to-test-recursive-server"/>.</para>

 <para>To enable DNSSEC validation on a BIND 9 recursive name server is easy, you only need two lines of configuration in your configuration file:
 <screen>options {
    dnssec-enable yes;
    dnssec-validation auto;
};</screen></para>

 <para>Restart named, and your recursive server is now happily validating each DNS response. If this does not work for you, you most likely have some other network-related configurations that need to be adjusted, take a look at <xref linkend="network-requirements"/> to make sure your network is ready for DNSSEC.</para>

 <para>Both lines listed above are actually the default configuration for BIND, it is your choice whether or not to explicitly list them in the configuration. To learn more about those two lines of configuration, please refer to <xref linkend="validation-easy-start-explained"/>.</para>
