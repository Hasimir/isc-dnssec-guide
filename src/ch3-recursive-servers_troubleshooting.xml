 <!-- ====== BIND DNSSEC Debug Logging ====== -->
 <!-- TODO: Is this too much information for a basic troubleshooting?
            Consider removing the debug logging section completely.
            The idea here is to provide a "reference" for other DNS
            administrators to see what a normal working validation
            looks like in syslog, so they can compare to their own
            syslog debug messages and see what may have gone wrong.

  <title>BIND DNSSEC Debug Logging</title>
  <para>Sometimes it may be necessary to enable BIND debug logging to see more details of how DNSSEC is validating (or not). DNSSEC-related messages are not recorded in syslog by default, even if query log is enabled, only DNSSEC errors will show up in syslog. Enabling debug logging is not recommended for production servers, as it increases load on the server.</para>
  <para>The example below shows how to enable debug level 3 (to see full DNSSEC validation messages) in BIND9 and have it sent to syslog:
<screen>logging {
   channel dnssec_log {
        syslog daemon;
        severity debug 3;
        print-category yes;
    };
    category dnssec { dnssec_log; };
};</screen></para>

  <para>After restarting BIND, a large number of log messages will appear in syslog. The example below shows the log messages as a result of successfully looking up and validating the domain name www.isc.org.
