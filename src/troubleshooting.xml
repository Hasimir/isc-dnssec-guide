   <title>Basic Troubleshooting</title>
   

   <!-- TODO jkuo Tue Oct 28 14:12:08 UTC 2014
        We'll come back and break this down later, for now, just
        take in the whole section from Recursive Server, the goal
        here is not to distinguish so much between recursive and
        authoritative, but focus on "this is the symptom" and
        "these are the possible causes"
   -->

   <note>
    <para>Reviewers: This new chapter combines troubleshooting techniques from both recursive and authoritative sections, and needs a re-write so it's more symptom-based. Also awaiting feedback on top-3 most commonly seen problems. It is currently under heavy construction.</para>

    <!-- Introduction to Troubleshooting -->
    <para>In this chapter, we are going to cover some basic troubleshooting techniques, common DNSSEC symptoms, and their solutions and causes. This is not a comprehensive "how to troubleshoot any DNS or DNSSEC problem" guide, because that in and of itself could easily be an entire book.</para>
