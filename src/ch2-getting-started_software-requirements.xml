  <title>Check BIND if DNSSEC-capable</title>
  <para>First of all, all versions of BIND9 supports DNSSEC. The BIND software you are running may already support DNSSEC as shipped. Run the command <command>named -V</command> to see what flags it was built with. If it was built with OpenSSL (<command>--with-openssl</command>), then it supports DNSSEC. Below is an example screenshot of running <command>named -V</command>:
  <screen>$ <userinput>/usr/sbin/named -V</userinput>
BIND 9.8.4-rpz2+rl005.12-P1 built with '--prefix=/usr' '--mandir=/usr/share/man' '--infodir=/usr/share/info'
'--sysconfdir=/etc/bind' '--localstatedir=/var' '--enable-threads' '--enable-largefile' '--with-libtool'
'--enable-shared' '--enable-static' <userinput>'--with-openssl=/usr'</userinput> '--with-gssapi=/usr' '--with-gnu-ld' '--with-geoip=/usr'
'--enable-ipv6' 'CFLAGS=-fno-strict-aliasing -DDIG_SIGCHASE -O2'
using OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
using libxml2 version: 2.8.0</screen>

  <para>If the BIND9 software you have does not support DNSSEC, it may be necessary to rebuild it from source. At the very minimum, you need to use the <command>--with-openssl</command> switch:
  <screen>$ <userinput>./configure --with-openssl</userinput>
$ <userinput>make</userinput>
$ <userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>

 <!-- ====== System Entropy ====== --> 
 <section id="system-entropy">
  <title>System Entropy</title>
  <para>If you plan on deploying DNSSEC to your authoritative server, you will need to generate some cryptographic keys. The amount of time it takes to generate the keys depends on the source of randomness, or entropy, on your systems. For most physical machines this is probably not an issue, since most operating systems have a mechanism to gather entropy from hardware components; for virtual machines however, entropy is sparse in comparison, thus generating keys on virtual machines can take much longer, sometimes into the range of several hours.</para>

  <para>There are software packages, such as <command>haveged</command> for Linux, that increase system entropy. Once installed, it will significantly reduce the time needed to generate keys from hours down to seconds.</para>
