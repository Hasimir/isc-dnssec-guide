  <para>With DNSSEC validation enabled, recursive name servers (validating resolver) will ask for additional resource records in its query, hoping the remote authoritative name servers will respond with DNSSEC-related answers. If DNSSEC responses are received, the validating resolver will perform cryptographic computation and hashing functions to verify that the data received was not altered during transit. It will repeat this process, tracing the keys (DNSKEY) all the way up the DNS delegation chain, to the zoneâ€™s parent, and its parent, and its parent, all the way until the validating resolver reaches a key that it trusts. In the ideal, fully deployed world of DNSSEC, all validating resolvers only need to trust one key: the root key (KSK).</para>
