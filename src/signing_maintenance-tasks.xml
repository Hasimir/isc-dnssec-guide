 <title>Maintenance Tasks</title>
 <para>Zone data is signed, parent zone has published your DS records, at this
 point your zone is officially secure. When other validating resolvers lookup
 information in your zone, they are able to follow the 12-step process as
 described in <xref linkend="how-does-dnssec-change-dns-lookup-revisited" />
 and verify the authenticity and integrity of the answers.</para>

 <para>There is not that much left for you to do, as the DNS administrator, at
 an ongoing basis. Whenever you update your zone, BIND will automatically
 resign your zone with new RRSIG and NSEC or NSEC3 records, and even increment
 the serial number for you.</para>

 <para>That leaves DNSKEY records. Just like passwords and underwear, keys need
 to be changed periodically. If you followed the examples in this guide with
 inline signing and automatic key management, the recurring tasks you need to
 perform are very limited. You should change your ZSK pair annually, and your
 KSK pair  every five years. This is also known as a key rollover (which we
 discuss in a little more detail in its own section <xref
 linkend="key-rollovers" />).</para>

 <para>Why annually for the ZSK? That's just a convenient length of time that
 probably coincides with your domain name registration/renewal cycle; And every
 five years? That's also a generic length of time, one which happens to be the
 same as the root key's rollover schedule.</para>

 <para>Some people feel or have the need to do it more frequently, and we will
 discuss those considerations in "Section Key Rolling". But assuming you do not
 have special security requirements, nor do you host a high valued zone,
 rotating your ZSK every year and KSK every five years should suffice.</para>


 <!-- ====== ZSK Rollover Example ====== -->
 <section id="maintenance-tasks-zsk-rollover">
  <title>ZSK Rollover</title>
  <para>Assuming you are rolling over ZSK every year on January 1st, you should
  perform the following commands at least 30 days in advance. For our example,
  we will say these commands are executed on December 1st of every year:

   <screen># <userinput>cd /etc/bind/keys/example.com/</userinput>
# <userinput>dnssec-settime -I 20150101 -D 20150201 Kexample.com.+008+17694</userinput>
./Kexample.com.+008+17694.key
./Kexample.com.+008+17694.private
# <userinput>dnssec-keygen -S Kexample.com.+008+17694</userinput>
Generating key pair..++++++ ...........++++++ 
Kexample.com.+008+59280</screen>

  </para>
  <para>The first command <code>dnssec-settime</code> sets an inactive (-I)
  date of January 1st, 2015, and a deletion (-D) date of February 1st, 2015 for
  the ZSK (Kexample.com.+008+17694). Then the second command
  <code>dnssec-keygen</code> creates a successor key, using the exact same
  parameters as the previous ZSK. The new key pair created in our example is
  Kexample.com.+008+59280. </para>

  <para>BIND will take care of the rest, the new ZSK will be published 30 days
  before the New Year, and on January 1st, the old key will become inactive
  (but still shows up in zone data), and the old key will removed from zone
  data come February 1st.</para>

  <para>For more information on key management (such as what inactive date is,
  and why 30 days for example), please see <xref
  linkend="advanced-discussions-key-management" />.</para>

 <!-- ====== KSK Rollover Example ====== -->
 <section id="maintenance-tasks-ksk-rollover">
  <title>KSK Rollover</title>
  <para>KSK rollover is very similar to ZSK, with the addition of interacting
  with the parent zone. In fact, you can follow the exact same procedures as
  described in <xref linkend="maintenance-tasks-zsk-rollover" />, on December
  1st, execute the same commands to set the inactive and deletion date for your
  old KSK, create a successor key pair. Then on the same day (December 1st),
  generate the new information (DS record, trusted-key statement, or whatever
  format your parent zone requires), and upload it to your parent zone. Then
  enjoy your holidays, and remove the old DS record on February 1st the
  following year from your parent zone.</para>
