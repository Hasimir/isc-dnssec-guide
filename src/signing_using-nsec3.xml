  <title>Using NSEC3</title>
  <para>After reloading the server configuration file, additional DNSSEC resource records are auto-magically generated. By default, BIND will generate NSEC records, this section describes how to switch to using NSEC3 records. To learn more about the difference between NSEC and NSEC3, please see <xref linkend="advanced-discussions-proof-of-nonexistence" />.</para>
  <para>This command below enables NSEC3 for the zone example.com, using a pseudo-random hex string 1234567890abcdef:
   <screen># <userinput>rndc signing -nsec3param 1 0 10 1234567890abcdef example.com</userinput></screen></para>

  <para>You'll know it worked if you see the following syslog messages:
   <screen>Oct 21 13:47:21 received control channel command 'signing -nsec3param 1 0 10 1234567890abcdef example.com'
Oct 21 13:47:21 zone example.com/IN (signed): zone_addnsec3chain(1,CREATE,10,1234567890ABCDEF)</screen></para>
