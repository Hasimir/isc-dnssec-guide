 <title>What does DNSSEC Add to DNS?</title>


 <!-- TODO: 
  Before talking about what is added to DNSSEC, do a very fast review of the use of
  public key cryptography for non-crypto geeks, and the use of digital signatures.
  Talk a little bit about key pairs, ZSK, and KSK, how keys are generated or obtained,
  but defer most of this to later sections. Talk at very high level of the "added"
  task of uploading DS records to parent, since this is a new concept for most zone
  administrators. -->
 <para>DNSSEC introduces six new resource record types:
