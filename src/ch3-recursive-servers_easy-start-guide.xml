 <title>Easy Start Guide for Recursive Servers</title>
 <para>This section provides the minimum amount of information to setup a working DNSSEC-aware recursive server, also known as a validating resolver. A validating resolver is performs validation for each remote response received, following the chain of trust to verify the answers it receives are legitimate through the use of public key cryptography and hashing functions.</para>
 
 <para>You may not need to reconfigure your name server at all, since recent versions of BIND has been shipped with DNSSEC validation enabled by default. Before making any configuration changes, check whether or not you already have DNSSEC validation by following steps described in <xref linkend="how-to-test-recursive-server"/>.</para>

 <!-- TODO: since both directives are set to 'yes' by default, do we want to advise readers to explicitedly declare yes here? -->
 <!-- TODO: and does this mean we don't want to recommend readers to set dnssec-validation to 'auto'? -->
 <para>To enable DNSSEC validation on a BIND 9 recursive name server is easy, you only need two lines of configuration in your configuration file:
 <screen>dnssec-enable yes;
dnssec-validation yes;</screen></para>

 <para>Restart named, and your recursive server is now happily validating each DNS response.</para> 
 <para>If this does not work for you, you most likely have some other network-related configurations that need to be adjusted, take a look at <xref linkend="network-requirements"/> to make sure your network is ready for DNSSEC.</para>
