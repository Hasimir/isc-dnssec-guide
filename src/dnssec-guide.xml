    <title>BIND DNSSEC Guide</title>

    <abstract>
      <para>This is version &__VERSION__; of the DNSSEC deployment guide for
      BIND.</para>

      <para>BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System
      (DNS) protocols for the Internet. It is a reference implementation of
      those protocols, but it is also production-grade software, suitable for
      use in high-volume and high-reliability applications.</para>

      <para>Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) extends standard
      DNS to provide a measure of security; it proves that the data comes from
      the official source and has not been modified in transit.</para>

      <para>ISC BIND supports the full DNSSEC standard.</para>

      <para>This document provides introductory information on how DNSSEC
      works, how to configure BIND to support some common DNSSEC features, as
      well as some basic troubleshooting tips. The chapters are organized as
      such:</para>

      <para><xref linkend="introduction" /> covers the intended audience for
      this document, assumed background knowledge, and a basic introduction to
      the topic of DNSSEC.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="getting-started" /> covers various requirements that
      are needed before implementing DNSSEC, such as software versions,
      hardware capacity, network requirements, and security changes.</para>
      
      <para><xref linkend="dnssec-validation" /> walks through setting up a validating
      resolver, as well as examples of using tools to verify the resolver is
      validating answers.</para>
      
      <para><xref linkend="dnssec-signing" /> walks through setting up a basic signed
      authoritative zone, explains the relationship with the parent zone, and
      on-going maintenance tasks.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="dnssec-troubleshooting" /> provides some tips on how to
      analyze and diagnose DNSSEC-related problems.</para>
      
      <para><xref linkend="dnssec-advanced-discussions" /> covers several topics,
      from key generation, key storage, key management, NSEC and NSEC3, to
      disadvantages of DNSSEC.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="dnssec-recipes" /> provides several working examples of
      common solutions, with step-by-step details.</para>
      
      <para><xref linkend="dnssec-commonly-asked-questions" /> lists some commonly
      asked questions and answers about DNSSEC.</para>
